            I’d love to hear about what you’re working on and how I could help. I’m currently
            looking for a my first job and am open to a wide range of opportunities. My preference
            would be to find a position in a company in Brazil where I can work remotely. But I’m
            also happy to hear about opportunites that don’t fit that description. I’m a dedicated
            person, willing to learn and who will always approach each task with a sense of purpose
            and attention to detail. Please do feel free to check out my online profiles below and
            get in touch using the form.
